Mini Pitch Deck – Actual Build Flow

1. 	Problem
College students juggle multiple assignments across courses. Canvas shows due dates but doesn’t help with prioritization or workload planning. The result is procrastination, missed deadlines, and stress.

2. 	Solution
We built the Canvas AI Assistant Extension, which transforms raw due dates into a ranked, actionable weekly plan. It provides smart priority ranking, sorting assignments by urgency and estimated effort, and adaptive reminders that feel like a study buddy rather than a nag.

3. 	Key Features
• 	Assignment extraction and sorting: pulls assignments directly from Canvas into the extension popup.
• 	Priority scoring and color coding: caching and classification logic ranks tasks and visually highlights urgency.
• 	Summarization and simplification: AI generates quick overviews and simplified prompts.
• 	UI evolution: iterated from a minimal list to a bubbly, chat‑style dashboard with playful badges and pill‑shaped highlights.
• 	Offline‑first design: client‑side logic ensures the extension works even without constant API calls.

4. 	Demo Flow
Step 1: Show the Canvas dashboard with upcoming assignments.
Step 2: Open the extension popup to display the ranked, color‑coded weekly list.
Step 3: Trigger a reminder notification that adapts to assignment type (for example, “Start your essay tonight—it’s heavier than your quiz”).
Step 4: Show how a dense assignment description is rewritten into a clear, student‑friendly version.
Step 5: Highlight the playful, chat‑style interface that makes planning feel less stressful.

5. 	Why It Wins
Purpose: Tackles a universal student pain point—planning and prioritization.
Execution: We didn’t just theorize; we iterated through real debugging, caching, and UI polish until it worked smoothly.
Scalability: Works for any Canvas user and can be adapted to other LMS platforms.
Judging fit: Perfect for the “Most Helpful – Chrome Extension” prize because it is practical, polished, and demo‑ready.
